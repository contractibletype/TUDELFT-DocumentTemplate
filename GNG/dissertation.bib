abstract = {The flexible coupling of sectors in the energy system, for example via battery electric vehicles, electric heating or electric fuel production, can contribute significantly to the integration of variable renewable electricity generation. For the implementation of the energy system transformation, however, there are numerous options for the design of sector coupling, each of which is accompanied by different infrastructure requirements. This paper presents the extension of the REMix energy system modelling framework to include the gas sector and its application for investigating the cost-optimal design of sector coupling in Germany's energy system. Considering an integrated optimisation of all relevant technologies in their capacities and hourly use, a path to a climate-neutral system in 2050 is analysed. We show that the different options for flexible sector coupling are all needed and perform different functions. Even though flexible electrolytic production of hydrogen takes on a very dominant role in 2050, it does not displace other technologies. Hydrogen also plays a central role in the seasonal balancing of generation and demand. Thus, large-scale underground storage is part of the optimal system in addition to a hydrogen transport network. These results provide valuable guidance for the implementation of the energy system transformation in Germany.}

abstract = {This work analyses the trading of strategic merchant hydrogen technologies in energy and ancillary services markets. The hydrogen firms trade in two markets: (1) a joint hydrogen and energy/reserves day-ahead market and (2) the balancing settlements market. We contrast the co-optimised markets with trading in an energy-only market. Trading both energy and ancillary services leads hydrogen firms to produce and use more hydrogen, leading to less reliance on fossil fuels and an increase in the revenue streams of the electrolysis-based firms. The problem is formulated as a stochastic multi-leader-multi-follower model. Each leader firm solves a bi-level Stackelberg problem. The upper-level is the Nash game among strategic firms. The lower-level is an instance of a Generalised Nash Equilibrium of the followers.}

abstract = {In the context of the participation of distributed energy resource (DER) aggregators in day-ahead energy and reserve markets, most of the existing analysis models of strategic bidding behavior of DER aggregators ignore the consideration of the safe operation of distribution systems. To this end, this paper builds a one-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game model considering the safety checking of distribution systems with the discrete features of capacitor banks and tap ratio of the substation transformer in the lower level. Mathematically, this model constitutes a bi-level mixed-integer nonlinear programming (BMINLP) problem. We convert the BMINLP model to a bi-level mixed-integer linear programming (BMILP) model based on KKT conditions, strong duality theorem, and big-M approach, which is still difficult to be solved directly. As a result, we propose a customized data-driven algorithm based on sampling without tuning hyper-parameters and an improved linear surrogate function method, to accurately fit the corresponding constraints of the lower-level model of BMILP problem, and then transform the BMILP problem into a single-level mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem to solve. The simulation of data-driven algorithm and comparison with the particle swarm optimization algorithm shows the high practicability of the bi-level Stackelberg game model and the effectiveness of the data-driven algorithm.}

  abstract={This paper proposes a bi-level robust planning model to address the rational configuration of a hydrogen energy system, accounting for the impact of wind power uncertainty in an integrated electricity–heat–hydrogen energy system (IEHHES) with the increasing wind power penetration. The upper-level problem aims to determine the capacity of the hydrogen energy system in this system, whereas the lower-level problem is formulated as a two-stage robust optimization model to simulate the typical daily operational scheme of the system, considering uncertain wind turbine output and the on/off switching of devices. This model considers multiple hydrogen utilization modes and the physical characteristics of various hydrogen storage tanks. The complex bi-level robust model is intractable directly. Therefore, this bi-level robust planning model is initially decomposed into planning and operation subproblems. These subproblems are then can be solved in parallel using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm; the planning subproblem, a quadratic programming model, is solved using a commercial solver; the operating subproblem, a two-stage robust optimization model, is solved using the column and constraint generation algorithm. Finally, case studies validate the advantages and effectiveness of the developed model and algorithm.}

abstract = {This paper represents a model for finding the strategic bidding equilibrium of a virtual power plant in a joint energy and regulation market in the presence of rivals. A bi-level mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) is represented for modeling the behavior of each producer. The upper level deals with profit maximization of each strategic unit and the lower level encompasses social welfare maximization. This is the first objective of the presented model. Power transfer distribution factors (PTDFs) are employed to model transmission constraints. The proposed bi-level problem is converted to a traceable mixed integer linear programming problem using duality theory and Karush-Kahn-Tucker (KKT) optimization conditions. Simultaneous solution of all MPECs forms an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC). Solving the resulting EPEC using diagonalization algorithm and game theory, a market Nash equilibrium is obtained. Another goal is to solve the bi-level problem in a bi-objective way using the augmented epsilon constraint method, which maximizes the profit and minimizes the emissions of virtual power plant units. The proposed model is tested on a standard IEEE-24 bus system and the results indicate that, at the equilibrium point, the profit of a virtual power plant and GenCo will be less than in the initial state.}

abstract = {Abstract The interest conflict among entities in the integrated energy system (IES) has a great challenge to operation decisions of IES. With regards to this, an optimal dispatching model of electric-heat-hydrogen IES based on Stackelberg game is proposed. Firstly, an energy producer (EP) model is formulated which considered the full utilization of hydrogen energy and involved the conversion of hydrogen energy to electricity and heat energy. Meanwhile, the demand response amount is integrated into the objective function of load aggregator (LA) in order to encourage consumers to adjust their consumption behaviour. Secondly, by analyzing the characteristics of price information interaction among EP, energy system operator (ESO), and LA, the payoffs of each entity in IES are reformulated. Finally, a Stackelberg game model is established with ESO as the dominator guiding price information, EP and LA as the followers whose private information is confidential. Genetic algorithm and quadratic programming algorithm (GA-QP) are employed to solve the developed model. Numerical experiments are carried out on an actual park-level IES in northern China to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in promoting the benefit equilibrium among various entities.},

abstract = {The flexible coupling of sectors in the energy system, for example via battery electric vehicles, electric heating or electric fuel production, can contribute significantly to the integration of variable renewable electricity generation. For the implementation of the energy system transformation, however, there are numerous options for the design of sector coupling, each of which is accompanied by different infrastructure requirements. This paper presents the extension of the REMix energy system modelling framework to include the gas sector and its application for investigating the cost-optimal design of sector coupling in Germany's energy system. Considering an integrated optimisation of all relevant technologies in their capacities and hourly use, a path to a climate-neutral system in 2050 is analysed. We show that the different options for flexible sector coupling are all needed and perform different functions. Even though flexible electrolytic production of hydrogen takes on a very dominant role in 2050, it does not displace other technologies. Hydrogen also plays a central role in the seasonal balancing of generation and demand. Thus, large-scale underground storage is part of the optimal system in addition to a hydrogen transport network. These results provide valuable guidance for the implementation of the energy system transformation in Germany.}

abstract = {This work analyses the trading of strategic merchant hydrogen technologies in energy and ancillary services markets. The hydrogen firms trade in two markets: (1) a joint hydrogen and energy/reserves day-ahead market and (2) the balancing settlements market. We contrast the co-optimised markets with trading in an energy-only market. Trading both energy and ancillary services leads hydrogen firms to produce and use more hydrogen, leading to less reliance on fossil fuels and an increase in the revenue streams of the electrolysis-based firms. The problem is formulated as a stochastic multi-leader-multi-follower model. Each leader firm solves a bi-level Stackelberg problem. The upper-level is the Nash game among strategic firms. The lower-level is an instance of a Generalised Nash Equilibrium of the followers.}

We analyse flexibility in a two-stage decision process where production decided at the last moment is more costly than if it is planned in advance. We first determine the first best outputs, prices and gains. We then consider a model where two partially flexible firms compete in quantities to supply a random residual demand. We determine the subgame perfect equilibria corresponding to two market designs: one where all trade occurs in a spot market with known demand, the other where a day-ahead market with random demand is added to the ex-post market, first in a general setting, then using a quadratic specification. We show that when all trade occurs ex post, the least flexible firm is not necessarily disadvantaged. We also show that adding a day-ahead market makes consumers better off and firms worse off by increasing total output. It increases welfare but it also transfers risks from firms to consumers.},
